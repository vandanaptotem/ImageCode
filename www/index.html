                                    The killer was Bhairav Thakur.

                                    Bhairav was jealous of Kamal’s growing popularity. Kamal was the barber
                                    that people went to and Bhairav could not stand that. He also knew that
                                    now would be the right time to get rid of him as he Kamal had problems
                                    with the loan shark as well as his son-in-law. So the finger of
                                    suspicion wouldn’t be pointed at him (Bhairav). All this prompted
                                    Bhairav to move swiftly and execute what he thought was a well-planned
                                    murder to get rid of his only competition in the village.

                                    What happened that day?

                                    After shutting his barber shop for the day, Kamal went to the lake for
                                    some alone time. Little did he know that he was being followed by none
                                    other than Bhairav. As Kamal bent down to splash some water on his face,
                                    Bhairav approached him from behind and caught him. A struggle ensued to
                                    which Bhairav overpowered Kamal and finally took Kamal’s blade and slit
                                    his throat. Once the deed was done, Bhairav took Kamal’s ring to make
                                    it look like a robbery (shifting the blame to either the loan shark or
                                    the son-in-law). Little did he know that I was on the case and such
                                    tricks don’t work with me.<p>1 days ago</p></div>

                                    I think it's raju kishan. because the ring of kamal is missing, which
                                    might have been taken by raju as he was in need of money. Rival barber
                                    could have just killed him but no reason for him to take the ring. <p>3 days

                                    The decision was between Bhairav Thakur and Raju Kishan. However, the
                                    way Kamal was killed suggests that it was done by someone skilled in the
                                    use of blades. Hence, Bhairav is the killer. He did it out of jealousy
                                    and to protect his source of livelihood.<p>3 days ago</p></div>

                                    I think the killer is Raju Kishan. I think he killed his father in law
                                    so that he could sell off his property and then move to the big city. <p>3
